## NOTICE: End of Life for Place-Puppy.com
### Place Puppy will shut down on September 27, 2023 


Place Puppy will cease service on September 27, 2023 at 12:00am EST.


Place-Puppy came online in 2018 and has always been entirely self-funded. Sadly in today's market, this is just no longer feasible.

If you use place-puppy.com consistently in your work, please switch over to another service before the shutdown date, i.e. the OG [Place Kitten](https://placekitten.com/).

Thank you to everyone that used one of our puppies over the years. Hopefully we made your prototypes just a little bit cuter.
